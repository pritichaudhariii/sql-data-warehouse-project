**Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**
------------

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀

This repository showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from building the warehouse to delivering actionable insights. It emphasizes best practices in data engineering, ETL processes, and modern analytics architecture.


**Data Architecture**
------------

This project is built on the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data into three progressive layers — Bronze, Silver, and Gold — ensuring data quality, reliability, and business-ready insights.

Bronze Layer 🥉 – Captures raw data directly from source systems. In this project, data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database without modification.

Silver Layer 🥈 – Focuses on cleaning, standardizing, and normalizing the ingested data to ensure consistency and analytical readiness.

Gold Layer 🥇 – Contains curated, business-ready datasets organized in a star schema, optimized for reporting and advanced analytics.

**Project Overview**
------------

This project involves:

1. Data Architecture 🏗️ – Building a modern data warehouse using the Medallion framework with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

2. ETL Pipelines 🔄 – Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source files into the warehouse.

3. Data Modeling 📊 – Designing fact and dimension tables structured for efficient analytical queries.

4. Analytics & Reporting 📈 – Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards to uncover actionable business insights.


**📂 Project Scope & Data Handling**
------------

1. Data Sources – Import data from two systems (ERP and CRM), provided as CSV files.

2. Data Quality – Apply cleansing and validation to address inconsistencies before analysis.

3. Integration – Merge both sources into a unified, analysis-friendly data model.

4. Scope – Work with the latest dataset only (no historization required).

5. Documentation – Deliver clear data model documentation to support both business users and analytics teams.
